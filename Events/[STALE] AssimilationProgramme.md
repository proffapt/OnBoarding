# Assimilation Programme

For the first time under Shivam Kumar Jha (Technology Coordinator, 2019-2020) a section for OpenSource and Career In Technology was included in the assimilation programme which is conducted each academic for Sophomores.

## How To Approach

This programme is jointly conducted by [Metakgp](https://metakgp.github.io/), [KOSS](https://kossiitkgp.org) and Gymkhana. Below are the steps that are needed for the conduction of the event:

- Approach the VP and make him aware of the requirement of the programme; section on why this is required is added below.
- Approach the current UG Head and make him aware of the same, provide details shared with VP.
- Approach the maintainers of [Metakgp](https://metakgp.github.io/) and executives of [KOSS](https://kossiitkgp.org) and request them for the preparation of content and presentation of the same.
- The presentation should be jointly delivered by volunteering members of [KOSS](https://kossiitkgp.org), [Metakgp](https://metakgp.github.io/) and the Technology Coordinator.

## Why Is This Required

A document was jointly prepared by Technology Coordinator, [KOSS](https://kossiitkgp.org) and [Metakgp](https://metakgp.github.io/) on why this event is necessary. Please

It is highly encouraged to keep this document up-to-date with the current happenings in the campus. 

## What Next

We aim to have a similar section in the Induction Programme which is conducted for freshers. A more sound reasoning and more information
