## Gymkhana Website

<a id="gw-objective"></a>

### Objective 

This site contains all the public information of gymkhana and targets the general audience in and out of IIT Kharagpur. This is to provide the target audience with the facilities that gymkhana have, the events it conduct, the way it ensures the mission and vision, etc.

<a id="gw-maintenance"></a>

### Maintenance 

This is site is built with React.js. The data of contacts, events, results, etc needs to be regularly updated. Based on the requirement, new pages and sections need to be developed. The data is static for now. It has to be fetched from the [backend](#gymkhana-backend) api after developing the dashboard and populating the database. For more details, visit: [tsg-iitkgp/web-frontend](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/web-frontend). <br/>
Link to the deployed site: [https://gymkhana.iitkgp.ac.in](https://gymkhana.iitkgp.ac.in)

<a id="gw-features"></a>

### Features

The following are a few features of the website which are very essential and needs to be worked upon every year:
- Live Scoreboard: General Championship and Inter IIT
- Events Page
- Admin Dashboard
- Certificate Generator
- Committees Pages
- Contacts of Current and Past Office Bearers
- Information Pages: General Championship, Inter IIT, TSG Awards, Illumination, etc

#### Live Scoreboard

Live scoreboard was initiated during the academic session 2021 - 2022 and was a huge success. This feature on gymkhana website has a proper value addition to the student community. This needs to be updated year-on-year and to be kept alive.

#### Events Page

This page contains the current and past events of gymkhana. An **events calendar** can also be added here in the future. The events listed here can be edited through the Events Update feature of the Admin Dashboard.

### Admin Dashboard
It was created to access any feature which is restricted to TSG Office bearers or Secretaries, such as the Certificate Generator and Events Update. 
If any new such feature is developed, it should be added to the Admin Dashboard.

### Certificate Generator
This feature is a recent addition, placed in the Admin Dashboard, to digitalise the generation as well as distribution of the certificates to be issued to students by TSG.

#### Information Pages

These are a few separate set of pages which are wholely meant to provide basic knowledge to the students regarding the events such as Inter IIT, General Championship, TSG Awards, Illumination, etc.
Instead of having pages only for the results of the events, these pages would exhaustively give the info to the users.


#### Committees Pages

These are custom pages for each committee which would contain all the information regarding the events, results, competitions, etc conducted by the committee. This is a one-stop page to know about the committee. It can be made dynamic too so that it can be modified using Admin Dashboard.

#### Office Bearers Contacts

Data of the current and past office bearers of gymkhana will be displayed here. This can be improvised more to show images and contacts of past office bearers as well.

<a id="tsgblogs-objective"></a>

The Heads of the Developers' Society (3rd year students) are responsible for the maintenance and upgradation of the ApnaInsti App, which has to be eventually taken care of by the Technology Coordinator.

<a id="ai-existence"></a>

### Existence
The ideation and foundation of the app was originally done by Mr Shivam Kumar Jha (Technology Coordinator 2019-20) which was later on revised by Ms Devaki Nandana Vardhineedi (Vice President 2021-22) and remarkable advancements were achieved by Mr Praneeth Reddy Kolanu ( Technology Coordinator 2021-22). Afterwards, the final planning and execution was led by Kunal Verma (Technology Coordinator 2022-23) and the Tech Team (2022-23), eventually leading to the formation of Developersâ€™ Society which then developed ApnaInsti.

The idea is to develop a single modular backend which can cater for all the frontend applications developed by the TechTeam. It currently hosts the Gymkhana Website and Blogs Website. 

<a id="gb-maintenance"></a>

### Maintenance

This project is based on Expressjs and SQLite database. There's a seperate module developed for each of the application. Do not disturb any module if you are not working on its application. Create a new module similar to the previous ones, if you are developing a new frontend and needs a backend. The backend is currently hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS.
