# TODOs

In this doc, we track decisions that need to be made or important information that needs to be passed on from the past technology coordinator. All the applications which are to be maintained by the TechTeam are clearly defined [here](APPs.md). Apart from those, add all TODOs in this document here with dates, and mark when they're finished or further action has been taken.

## 25th April 2022

1. **Build a Dashboard for TSG website:** Idea is to make the TSG site dynamic and build a web interface where any non-tech person can login and manage the data of socieites, contacts, opportunities, FAQs, awards, GC results, etc. It should serve as the central controlling unit of the entire website. The events page is currently dynamic.

2. **Add more value added pages on TSG Site:** Right now, we have dedicated pages for General Championship and TSG Awards but they don't contain any general information regarding the events. These pages only have results of those events. So, the idea is to make these pages more exhaustive and develop more such pages for other flagship events such as Illumination, Inter IIT, etc. These pages would include all the information regarding the events such as objective, conduction, general timeline, results, legacy, gallery, captains' contacts, etc

3. **Feature updates for Inventory System:** The [Digital Inventory System](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/tsg-inventory-system/blob/main/README.md), which has came into existence in the year 2022, is being used by all the sporting staff of Gymkhana. Regular feedback has to be taken from the users of the Inventory System and feature updates need to be provided. Publish this application on Microsoft Store and Linux Apt/Snap Store. So that, updates can be automated.

4. **Standardize the Live Scoreboard of GC:** Live scoreboard was initiated during the academic session 2021 - 2022 and was a huge success. It was made in a very short span just considering it to be functional and usable. The current implementation of the Live Scoreboard ( UI especially) can be improved a lot and needs attention. The feature must look appealing and attract a lot of traffic through it.

5. **Improve the Certificate Generator:** At present, the Certificate Generator is a very useful utility indeed but still requires intervention by the Tech Team. The whole process needs to be improvised in order to make it more user friendly and robust.
