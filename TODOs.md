# TODOs

In this document, we track decisions that need to be made or important information that needs to be passed on from the previous Technology coordinator. All the applications which are to be maintained by the TechTeam are clearly defined [here](APPs.md). Apart from those, add all TODOs in this document here with dates, and mark when they're finished or further action has been taken.

## 15th April 2024

1. [ToDo/Idea list for Gymkhana Website](https://gist.github.com/proffapt/5129f19cb4a1a8df57f35b8efcdc8c1f)
2. [ToDo/Idea list for ApnaInsti Application](https://gist.github.com/proffapt/cccfe8ccfa3ffb845cec7d043a402e74)
3. [Common dasboard for site and application](https://gist.github.com/proffapt/54f235d29a1061e7cee2d691676e1ae2)
4. **Add more value added pages on TSG Site:** Right now, we have dedicated pages for General Championship and TSG Awards but they don't contain any general information regarding the events. These pages only have results of those events. So, the idea is to make these pages more exhaustive and develop more such pages for other flagship events such as Illumination, Inter IIT, etc. These pages would include all the information regarding the events such as objective, conduction, general timeline, results, legacy, gallery, captains' contacts, etc
5. **Feature updates for Inventory System:** The [Digital Inventory System](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/tsg-inventory-system/blob/main/README.md), which has came into existence in the year 2022, is being used by all the sporting staff of Gymkhana. Regular feedback has to be taken from the users of the Inventory System and feature updates need to be provided. Publish this application on Microsoft Store and Linux Apt/Snap Store. So that, updates can be automated.
