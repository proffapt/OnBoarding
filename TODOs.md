# TODOs

In this doc, we track decisions that need to be made or important information that needs to be passed on from the past technology coordinator. All the applications which are to be maintained by the TechTeam are clearly defined [here](APPs.md). Apart from those, add all TODOs in this document here with dates, and mark when they're finished or further action has been taken.

## 25th April 2022

1. **Build a Dashboard for TSG website:** Idea is to make the TSG site dynamic and build a web interface where any non-tech person can login and manage the data of events, notices, socieites, contacts, opportunities, FAQs, awards, GC results, etc.

2. **Add more value added pages on TSG Site:** Right now, we have dedicated pages for General Championship and TSG Awards but they don't contain any general information regarding the events. These pages only have results of those events. So, the idea is to make these pages more exhaustive and develop more such pages for other flagship events such as Illumination, Inter IIT, etc. These pages would include all the information regarding the events such as objective, conduction, general timeline, results, legacy, gallery, captains' contacts, etc

3. **Feature updates for Inventory System:** The [Digital Inventory System](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/tsg-inventory-system/blob/main/README.md), which has came into existence in the year 2022, is being used by all the sporting staff of Gymkhana. Regular feedback has to be taken from the users of the Inventory System and feature updates need to be provided. Publish this application on Microsoft Store and Linux Apt/Snap Store. So that, updates can be automated.

4. **Update the past Technology Coordinators data on TSG site:** As of now, we have the data of Technology Coordinators only from the academic session 2017-2018. It has been found that the Technology Coordinator position exists even before that. So, the data needs to be fetched and updated on the site.

5. **Standardize the Live Scoreboard of GC:** Live scoreboard was initiated during the academic session 2021 - 2022 and was a huge success. It was made in a very short span just considering it to be functional and usable. Before the next General Championship begins, develop a proper platform on TSG Website where the Live Updates and Scores of the General Championship of all the three committees (Sports, Social & Cultural, and Technology) can be seen.

6. **Transfer the data to new Email:** An official email ID (tech.coordi@iitkgp.ac.in) for technology coordinator has been created. All the accounts and data are to be shifted from the previous mail ID (tech.tsgiitkgp@gmail.com) to this new mail ID.
