### Who Is Technology Coordinator?

Technology Coordinator is a nominated post in the Technology Students' Gymkhana, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. The nominated person is responsible for the technological expansion of Gymkhana and the institute and is directly responsible for maintaining the Gymkhana website and implementing proposals of various Gymkhana office bearers.

The TechCord is also encouraged to have his own ideas and implement them as and when necessary and deemed appropriate after a discussion with Vice President and other associated office bearers.

### How is TechCord selected

```text
1. Request for submission of resumes of interested candidates.
2. Shortlisted candidates are called for an interview chaired by the present VP, upcoming VP, and the current TechCord.
```

### Tech Team

The Gymkhana tech team was introduced by Shivam Kumar Jha (Technology Coordinator 2019-20), to streamline all efforts, and maintain projects, along with coming up with new ideas for the betterment of the institute.

[More details on the tech team](TechTeam.md)

### What Once Nominated?

Once nominated, the new TechCord should do the following:

1. Go through this repository to understand the role and responsibilities better.

2. Have a discussion with the previous tech coordinator, about the state of the [projects](APPs.md) they were working on, and the [TODOs](TODOs.md) from their tenure. It is important to gather their experience and learn from their mistakes.

3. Get added to the GitHub org as an admin.

4. Request edit access to the credentials sheet. DO NOT give edit access to anybody else. If needed, make read-only copies, or preferably share only the credentials needed.

5. Get your SSH key added to the AWS server running [Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/introduction/) for the [Gymkhana blog](https://tsgblog.iitkgp.ac.in/), [Gymkhana Backend](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/tsg-backend), [Gymkhana Website](https://github.com/tsg-iitkgp/tsg-site).

6. Get your SSH key added to the Gymkhana server available in the board room of Gymkhana.

7. Get access to the `tech.tsgiitkgp@gmail.com` and `tech.coordi@iitkgp.ac.in`, and update the phone number and email signature to the present tech coordinator.

8. Update the contacts page with the new office bearer info. We also need to update the archival data, this is done on Google Sheets presently. Get access to the formatted and compiled datasheets.

NOTE: **It is very important to read all the points mentioned in the etiquettes' section and follow (or amend) them.**

The formation of the Gymkhana Tech Team is also the responsibility of the Technology Coordinator.

The point of contact inside Gymkhana and CIC is Alokes Chattopadhyay, Deputy Chief System Manager, Computer & Informatics Centre. Mail him the DNS record, if there's any requirement or modification of any subdomain of the institute's domain - iitkgp.ac.in. You can take his assitance in case of any network or IP related issue with the server. The server is running `Ubuntu 20.04`, with kernel version 5.11.0, so find packages that will work on it.

Addition of any new account on any platform should be added back to the sheet.

### Etiquettes

Below are some of the etiquettes established and are recommended to be followed:

- All code (unless confidential) should be made available under Gymkhana organization on Github.
- All **minutes of the meetings should be shared** with the Vice President, and the UG Representative from the aforementioned official Email ID. There should be a single thread for minutes of the meeting of a particular topic and should begin with "TechTeam: Minutes Of The Meeting". All minutes of the meetings of the tenure **should be documented and uploaded as pdf** in the drive folder named "Minutes Of The Meetings". The name of the document should be in the format "< Tenure Start Year > - < Tenure End Year >.pdf". **Follow the exact template** as present in the document named Template present in the drive folder.
- **Add new ideas and the incomplete work to the issues tab** of this repository so that they can be passed on easily.
- [Get Society Wiki Page](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Category:Societies_and_clubs) updated by the respective societies; **use last year's mail** as the template (available in official Gmail account with subject "Update Your Organisation's MetaKGP Wiki Page"). Take email address of all previous governors of all societies from the past PR chair and send them a mail to update the wiki page.
- Posts which are to be sent every year are present in the current GitHub repository; they must be sent again or removed after discussion with former Technology Coordinator.
- Events to be managed are present in the folder events. These should either be conducted every academic year or marked with "[STALE]" if considered outdated or not to be done. A future coordinator may decide to restart them with discussion with former TechCord.
- As the new Gymkhana editors are announced, an account for each should be made and credentials should be given. Along with the same, last year user accounts should be removed and their contribution should be attributed to the Technology Coordinator account. Share docs on the Ghost platform, and make sure they're comfortable with it.
- A project timeline should be created by the Technology Coordinator at the beginning of the tenure and in the same, he should circulate a document asking all of the Gymkhana position holders to suggest updates for the website.

NOTE: It is advisable to use the existing Google Sheets for all repeating processes by creating a new sheet in the spreadsheet.
