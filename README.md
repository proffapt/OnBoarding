The nominated person is responsible for the technological expansion of Gymkhana and the institute and is directly responsible for maintaining the Gymkhana website and implementing proposals of various Gymkhana office bearers.

The TechCord is also encouraged to have his own ideas and implement them as and when necessary and deemed appropriate after a discussion with Vice President and other associated office bearers.

### How is TechCord selected

The process for the nomination of Technology Coordinator begins after the election of new Vice President. Below are the steps for the process:

```text
1. Request for submission of resumes of interested candidates.
2. Shortlisted candidates are called for an interview chaired by the present VP, upcoming VP, and the current TechCord.
```

### Selection of Assisstant TechCords

NOTE: This section is outdated and Tech-Team has replaced assisstant technical coordinators.

The nominated person is also responsible for the nomination of Assistant Technology Coordinators. The number of bearers can be decided depending upon the planned amount of work; generally, it is 2.

The assistant TechCords will be responsible for assisting TechCord in his ideas and also provide ideas for the technological betterment of the institute.

TechCord and Assistant TechCords should work as a single body to gather, implement and execute ideas.

### What Once Nominated?

Once nominated, the new TechCord should immediately go through the README of this repository and ask the previous TechCord to grant him permission to view the credentials' sheet. 

NOTE: **It is very important to read all the points mentioned in the etiquettes' section and follow (or amend) them.**

Ethically, the newly nominated person should also gather experience of the former TechCord and Assistant TechCords and learn from their mistakes and experience and take note of the projects they have been working on.

Formation of Gymkhana Tech Team is also the responsibility of Technology Coordinator and more details are available in the same repository inside the file `TechTeam.md`

### Associated Accounts

TechCord is solely responsible for the maintenance of the associated accounts available in the tech-coord credentials sheet.

Follow the below procedure to get all the accounts:

- Request edit access to the credentials' sheet (available with the previous tech coordinator).
- Apart from the accounts mentioned in the sheet, we do not have any other associated accounts.
- Ask former TechCord to make your admin of the Github Organisation.
- Get all the private Gymkhana repositories transferred from the former TechCord.

NOTE: As of now, we **do not** have any private repositories for GymKhana.

The point of contact inside GymKhana and CIC is [Alokes Chattopadhyay](http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=ZamZU&depts_name=CC), Senior System Analyst, Computer & Informatics Centre.

Addition of any new account on any platform should be added back to the sheet.

### Etiquettes

Below are some of the etiquettes established and are recommended to be followed:

- All code (unless confidential) should be made available under Gymkhana organization on Github.
- All minutes of the meetings should be shared with the Vice President from the aforementioned official EmailID. There should be a single thread for minutes of the meeting of a particular topic and should begin with "Minutes Of The Meeting".
- A form should be posted right after the nomination or after a week of end-sems getting over (whichever is later), to gain feedback and ideas for the next session.
- **Add new ideas and the incomplete work to the issues tab** of this repository so that they can be passed on easily.
- [Get Society Wiki Page](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Category:Societies_and_clubs) updated by the respective societies; **use last year's mail** as the template (available in official Gmail account with subject "Update Your Organisation's MetaKGP Wiki Page"). Take email address of all previous governors of all societies from the past PR chair and send them a mail to update the wiki page.
- Posts which are to be sent every year are present in the current GitHub repository; they must be sent again or removed after discussion with former Technology Coordinator.
- Events to be managed are present in the folder events. These should either be conducted every academic year or marked with "[STALE]" if considered outdated or not to be done. A future coordinator may decide to restart them with discussion with former TechCord.
- As the new Gymkhana editors are announced, an account for each should be made and credentials should be given. Along with the same, last year user accounts should be removed and their contribution should be attributed to Technology Coordinator account.
- A portal for assimilation programme is present at the [Official GymK Website](http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ac.in/blog/index.php/grievance-portal-assimilation-programme-2019/). The same needs to be updated for the new assimilation programme with updating the form and adding new addresses for recipients.
- A project timeline should be created by the Technology Coordinator at the beginning of the tenure and in the same, he should circulate a document asking all of the GymKhana position holders to suggest updates for the website.


NOTE: It is advisable to use the existing Google Sheets for all repeating processes by creating a new sheet in the spreadsheet.
