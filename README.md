### What Once Nominated?

Once nominated, the new TechCord should do the following:

1. Go through this repository to understand the role and responsibilities better

2. Have a discussion with the previous tech coordinator, about the state of the projects they were working on, and the TODOs from their tenure. It is important to gather their experience, and learn from their mistakes

3. Get added to the GitHub org as an admin

4. Request edit access to the credentials sheet. DO NOT give edit access to anybody else. If needed, make read-only copies, or preferrably share only the credentials needed

5. Get your SSH key added to the AWS server running Ghost, for the GymK blog

6. Get your SSH key added to the Gymkhana server, and ensure you have access and permissions are configured properly for the `/home/gymkhana` directory

7. Get access to the `tech.tsgiitkgp@gmail.com` account, and update phone number to the present tech coordinator

8. Update the contacts page with the new office bearer info. We also need to update the archival data, this is done on Google Sheets presently. Get access to the formatted and compiled data sheets

    

NOTE: **It is very important to read all the points mentioned in the etiquettes' section and follow (or amend) them.**

Formation of Gymkhana Tech Team is also the responsibility of Technology Coordinator

The point of contact inside Gymkhana and CIC is [Alokes Chattopadhyay](http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=ZamZU&depts_name=CC), Senior System Analyst, Computer & Informatics Centre. In order to get any package installed or updated on the Gymkhana server, write a mail with the EXACT command to be run. The server is running `Ubuntu 14.04`, with kernel version 3.13, so find packages that will work on it

Addition of any new account on any platform should be added back to the sheet.

### Etiquettes

Below are some of the etiquettes established and are recommended to be followed:

- All code (unless confidential) should be made available under Gymkhana organization on Github.
- All minutes of the meetings should be shared with the Vice President, and UG Representative from the aforementioned official Email ID. There should be a single thread for minutes of the meeting of a particular topic and should begin with "Minutes Of The Meeting".
- **Add new ideas and the incomplete work to the issues tab** of this repository so that they can be passed on easily.
- [Get Society Wiki Page](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Category:Societies_and_clubs) updated by the respective societies; **use last year's mail** as the template (available in official Gmail account with subject "Update Your Organisation's MetaKGP Wiki Page"). Take email address of all previous governors of all societies from the past PR chair and send them a mail to update the wiki page.
- Posts which are to be sent every year are present in the current GitHub repository; they must be sent again or removed after discussion with former Technology Coordinator.
- Events to be managed are present in the folder events. These should either be conducted every academic year or marked with "[STALE]" if considered outdated or not to be done. A future coordinator may decide to restart them with discussion with former TechCord.
- As the new Gymkhana editors are announced, an account for each should be made and credentials should be given. Along with the same, last year user accounts should be removed and their contribution should be attributed to Technology Coordinator account. Share docs on the Ghost platform, and make sure they're comfortable with it
- A project timeline should be created by the Technology Coordinator at the beginning of the tenure and in the same, he should circulate a document asking all of the Gymkhana position holders to suggest updates for the website


NOTE: It is advisable to use the existing Google Sheets for all repeating processes by creating a new sheet in the spreadsheet.
